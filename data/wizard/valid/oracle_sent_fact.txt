92	language acquisition usually refers to first language acquisition , which studies infants ' acquisition of their native language	this is distinguished from " second language acquisition " , which deals with the acquisition ( in both children and adults ) of additional languages	second language acquisition ( sla ) , second language learning , or l2 ( language 2 ) acquisition , is the process by which people learn a second language	language is a system that consists of the development , acquisition , maintenance and use of complex systems of communication , particularly the human ability to do so and a language is any specific example of such a system	the hypothesis claims that there is an ideal time window to acquire language in a linguistically rich environment , after which further language acquisition becomes much more difficult and effortful	the field of second language acquisition is a subdiscipline of applied linguistics , but also receives research attention from a variety of other disciplines , such as psychology and education	reading education is the process by which individuals are taught to derive meaning from text	whole language practitioners teach to develop a

soon caught the attention of linguists , who saw her as an important way to gain further insight into acquisition of language skills and linguistic development	word recognition , according to literacy information and communication system ( lincs ) is " the ability of a reader to recognize written words correctly and virtually effortlessly "	reading comprehension is the ability to read text ,

process starting early in human life	a central theme in sla research is that of " interlanguage " , the idea that the language that learners use is not simply the result of differences between the languages that they already know and the language that they are learning , but that it is a complete language system in its own right , with its own systematic rules	it is often contrasted with phonics based methods of teaching reading and writing which emphasize instruction for decoding and spelling	if language input does not occur until after this time , the individual will never achieve a full command of language especially grammatical systems	for a fairly good reader , the skill of reading often feels simple , effortless , and automatic however , the process of learning to read is

the circumstances of genie , the primary victim in one of the most severe cases of abuse , neglect and social isolation on record in medical literature , first became known in early november 1970 , authorities arranged for her admission to children 's hospital los angeles , where doctors determined that at the age of 13 years and 7 months she had not acquired a first language	an individual 's ability to comprehend text is influenced by their traits and skills , one of which is the ability to make inferences	his views tended to focus on human development in relation to what is occurring with an individual as opposed to development that is influenced by other humans	if word recognition is difficult , students use too much of their processing capacity to read individual words , which interferes with their ability to comprehend what is read	genie ( born 1957 ) is the pseudonym for an american feral child who was a victim of severe abuse , neglect , and social isolation	it is sometimes referred to as " isolated word recognition " because it involves a reader 's ability to recognize words individually from a list without needing similar words for contextual help	each of these competencies is likewise dependent on lower level skills and cognitive abilities	although this definition may seem simple , it is not necessarily simple to teach , learn or practice	educators who embrace cognitive theory believe that the definition of learning as a change in behavior is too narrow and prefer to study the learner rather than their environment and in particular the complexities of human memory	learning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how knowledge is absorbed , processed , and retained during learning	the article " the science of word recognition " says that " evidence from the last 20 years of work in cognitive psychology indicates that we use the letters within a word to recognize a word "	at approximately the time she reached the age of 20 months he decided to keep her as socially isolated as possible as a result of this belief , so from that time until she reached the age of 13 years and 7 months he kept her locked alone in a
